# Key Value API
* Version 1.0.0

### Dependencies ###
this api uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Nodejsv8.9] - a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

* [Expressjs] - a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### How do I install and run it for the first time in development? (w/out docker) ###
Please do the following sequentially:

    1. Copy, edit and save server/config/config.json.example to server/config/config.json

    3. Install Dependencies
        * terminal
            ```bash
            npm install
            ```

    4. Run api
        * terminal
            ```bash
            npm start
            ```

### Contribution guidelines ###

* No direct push to major branches (master, develop) - all merge to master must pass through a pull request

### Who do I talk to? ###
